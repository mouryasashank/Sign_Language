# End to End Sign-Language Communication
This repository is about end to end communication between physically hearing impairment(person1) and outer world(person2).
<br>
from person1 to person2:
<br>
1.person 2 records the video of signs generated by person1.
<br>
2.the video is split into frames and body poses are taken from the frames. 
<br>
3.from body points and locations we map the sign gloss.
<br>
4.from sign gloss to english is translated through NLP techniques.
<br>
**gloss to german**
