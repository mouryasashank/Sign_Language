# End to End Sign-Language Communication
This repository is about end to end communication between physically hearing impairment(person1) and outer world(person2).

from person2 to person1:
<br>
1.The hearing impaired person records the english text generated by a normal person.
<br>
2.the english words are then translated to sign gloss using NLP techniques in the machine.
<br>
3.body points are generated from sign gloss using database structure in way such that the body poses are reocorded by each word.
<br>
4.Using pix2pix GAN, video is generated.
<br>

## DYNAMIC TIME WRAPPING ##
<br>Postions of wrists,elbows,shoulder are plotted for a single video.<br>

<br>
Using the dynamic time wrapping and linear interpolation the body poses are obtianed in a sequence so that the 
video proceeds without any breaks.
<br>

## FILES ##
<br>
boston_preprocessing.py -- Writes a CSV file consisting of the sentence and respective video of each word in gloss.<br>
<br>
openpose.py -- extracts the skeleton frames from the frames of the video and stores in new file.<br>
<br>
dwt_boston104.py -- Dynamic time wrapping of wrists is done and a CSV file is made consisting of word and skeleton locations.<br>
<br>
training of gans are shown in https://github.com/saisriteja/sign-language-communication/blob/master/Scripts/Sentence_To_Skeleton/sign_language_sentence_to_video_generation.ipynb.
<br>


## NLP techniques output ##
<br>The results I achieved below are taken dataset from phenoix weather dataset for sign langauge by using Luong's attension based mechanism.

## Video generation using GAN. ##
![ezgif com-video-to-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48018142/70105307-72fed500-1666-11ea-8cfd-3532f6791c0f.gif)
<br> The video generated is the middle image among three shown above. I know the image is unclear but it does a good job tracing the hand and elbow joints.along with image processing techinques using some more time and epochs for training the GAN could improve the resolution.
